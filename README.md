# Cluster-Completeness-Calculator
The Completeness Calculator is a tool designed to estimate the completeness of star clusters in astronomical surveys. It predicts how many clusters are detected given their physical properties (mass, age, extinction) or photometric properties (magnitudes in different filters).
